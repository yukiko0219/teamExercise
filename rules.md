# X-Team 108 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks
List down all the tasks and distribute the tasks evenly, reflecting their capabilities and preferences.

## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks
By pushing our works to the remote shared repository as we progress with tasks, we can check the status of the project.
Regular meeting to discuss face to face about what has been done and what needs to be done.


## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
Regular meetings and group chat


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed
Let each other know in advance if we are facing difficulties meeting the deadlines and by checking each other's progress.


## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
Check group chat frequently.
Check changes in the repository before meetings.
